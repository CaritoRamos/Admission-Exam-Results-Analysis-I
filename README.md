# **Admission Exam Results Analysis – Public University in Lima**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes the admission exam results for the 2025-I intake of the UNMSM, Peru's oldest and most prestigious public university. The data was obtained through Web Scraping from the university's official website, which provides public access to exam results.  
By extracting, processing, and visualizing this data, the project aims to uncover key insights into applicant performance, career competitiveness, and score distribution.  

## **Web Scraping with Selenium in Python**  
### Automating the extraction of exam results:  
- Accessing the main page listing all academic programs.  
- Automatically navigating to each program’s link to extract results.  
- Extracting data from tables while handling pagination.  
- Implementing error handling to prevent disruptions if a program page fails to load.  
- Structuring and storing data for further analysis.  

## **Data Wrangling in Python to Enhance Data Quality**  
- Formatting corrections.  
- Creating new columns to optimize analysis.  
- Standardizing variables such as category names and campus locations.  

## **Analysis & Visualization in Power BI**  
With clean data, I developed a **Power BI dashboard** to uncover key insights into applicant performance:  
- Minimum and maximum scores per program and overall.  
- Ranking of the **top 10 programs** with the highest scores.  
- Total applicants vs. admitted students, categorized by program.  
- Global ranking based on exam scores.  
- Interactive filters to analyze trends by faculty and admission type.
